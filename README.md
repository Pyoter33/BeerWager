# BeerWager
## Goal
Creating a small app using Jetpack Compose with MVVM and Clean Architecture. The app is dedicated for friends who like to wager each other for beer. They would use the app to create wagers more easily and to remind them about upcoming wagers when the time comes.
## Architecture and tools
*  Jetpack Compose to create a minimalistic and flexible UI
*  Material 3 components to achieve the most modern look
*  MVVM with Clean Architecture to clearly define and separate presentation, domain and data layers
*  Dagger Hilt framework to perform dependency injection across the whole app
*  Kotlin Coroutines to achieve concurrency and multithreading
*  Room DB to create fast local database to store the wagers
*  AlarmManager to create notifications at exact times about upcoming wagers
*  WorkManager to reliably restart alarms after device reboot
*  Calendar Provider API to save wager reminders to system's calendar
